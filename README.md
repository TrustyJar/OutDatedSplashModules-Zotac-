# Zotacstore Monitor
This is a bot which montitors zotactstore.com for queues. It is done by scraping the queue site for response elements which may trigger
a queue. This was my very first coding project, and I did have some help with it. It is one very simple request and is basically 100%
outdated. You can use if you wish though.
