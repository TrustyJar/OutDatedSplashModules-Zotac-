Make sure if you want to attempt to patch this file, have a proxies.txt file to make sure u don't burn the fuck out of your local IP. Also make sure you can set sessions. 
I did not set any sessions in the code. You also have to chamge the monitor link, I did not set it to the correct URL. URL changes every release as a form of bot protection 
by queue it.
